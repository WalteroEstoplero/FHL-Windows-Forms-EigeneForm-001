# Lines starting with `#` are comments.

# Ignore files called 'file.ext'
# file.ext

# Comments can't be on the same line as rules!
# The following line ignores files called 'file.ext # not a comment'
# file.ext # not a comment 

# Ignoring files with full path.
# This matches files in the root directory and subdirectories too.
# i.e. otherfile.ext will be ignored anywhere on the tree.
# dir/otherdir/file.ext
# otherfile.ext
*.exe
*.dll

# Ignoring directories
# Both the directory itself and its contents will be ignored.
bin/
obj/
.vs/

# Ignoring files by extension
# All files with these extensions will be ignored in
# this directory and all its sub-directories.
# *.apk
# *.class
